# Overview

This project is a simple Python program that prints **"Hello World"** to the console.  
The goal of this software is to reinforce my understanding of Python fundamentals and the process of creating, running, and sharing code.  
By starting small, I aim to build a strong foundation that I can expand on as I continue to develop more complex projects.
